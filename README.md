This is basically the worst HTML code for a webpage that you will ever find. 
It was trial and error, every single time. A lot of Googling before ChatGPT and AI appeared in my life.
I learnt, therefore, I enjoyed it.
All the pictures here are of my authorship. Acknowledge it if you use it for something. 
If that something is a publication saying that it's yours, then, don't, because that's cheating.
You can always contact me. I don't bite. Except if I bite???
